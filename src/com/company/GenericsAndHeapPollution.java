            Now, the problem with Java generic types is that the type information is discarded by the compiler

            There are good reason for implementing generics like this in Java, but that's a long story,
            and it has to do with binary compatibility with pre-existing code.

            But the important point here is that since, at runtime there is no type information,

            The Java runtime would let you put whatever you want into this list, when it should only contain integers,
            because when it was created, it was declared as a list of integers.
